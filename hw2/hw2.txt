Design Document:
1. Name of the business is Ramen Shop.

2. Ramen shop provides ramen to customers. Their mission is to spread more of 
   Japanese ramen culture in the medford area. Additionally, college students 
   may get tired of eating dorm foods and that is where they help out by 
   providing authentic japanese ramen. 

3. The target is mainly Tufts college students. The location is right behind
   Tufts Carmichael Hall so Tufts students have easy access to Ramen Shop.

4. People have access to the menu online and having a general description of the
   restaurant online will attract more customers than one without it.
