        Enjoy one of the best authentic Japanese Ramen here at Ramen Shop! 
        There are many who have eaten ramen but not many have eaten our ramen. 
        Our mission is to spread more of Japanese ramen culture in the medford 
        area. Additionally, college students may get tired of eating dorm foods 
        and that is where we help out by providing our ramen.

        Ramen shop treasures the "natural flavor of the ingredients". We do not
        rely on chemically made flavors such as MSGs to make our bowl. 
        Everything is made from scratch, including the ramen noodles and the 
        soup broth. All the ingredients used are organic and thus is safe for 
        people of all ages and genders.
